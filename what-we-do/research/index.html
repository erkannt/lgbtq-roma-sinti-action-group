<p>In 2021, the National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights commissioned a peer-to-peer participatory action
research with the goal to unveil the isolation experienced by LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma, with the aim of creating an Ireland which is more LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma inclusive.</p>
<p>Author and lead researcher Dr Sarah  Sartori was accompanied in her research by three peer-researcher.The process was developed with a focus on participation and empowerment, and in recognition that peers are experts within their field of experience.</p>
<p>The research began in early 2021 and was completed in July 2022, and we understand it to be <strong>the largest study of LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma in Ireland to date</strong>. There were 57 engagements in total - 47 through an online survey tool, and 10 through focus-group discussions. </p>
<p>Arts-based methodologies such as Photovoice and transcript poetry were used to help participants and communities more broadly engage with the findings. Some examples of participant Photovoice and poems are included throughout the research report. </p>
<p>The study is gratefully supported by LGBT Ireland and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC).</p>
