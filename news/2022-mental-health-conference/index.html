    <h1>Traveller Mental Health Conference on 22nd November</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights had a stand at the Traveller Mental Health Conference. We were happy to see a huge interest in our resources and the newly published Peer-Research 'Unveiling Inequality'. With the research showing that LGBTI+ Travellers experience high levels of homelesseness, harassment and mental health issues, we want to make sure their mental health needs are considered. </p>
<p>Minister Mary Butler and all CHO areas were provided with the Peer-Research report 'Unveiling Inequality' and during a workshop we were able to engage in conversation with wonderful staff members from Traveller organsations around the country. </p>
